# Coordinates

This repository contains code files to create a Coordinates programme using OOP. Coordinates become points, neighbours are found within a set radius, a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm is used and SVG displays a visual representation of that MST.

This project was completed as part of a module at Abertay University with module tutor: Stefan Binder (2024).
